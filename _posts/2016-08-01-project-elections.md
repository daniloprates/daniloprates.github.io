For this project I helped my 4-member team to decide the techmnologies and languages to be used. We chose to use Mithril.js, due to its minimal size and great features.

Powered by Halley, UOL's websocket server, the scoreboard received over 17 milion unique visitors in one day span.

It allowed the user to favorite cities and candidates do follow the votings count.

Using a feature that allowed it to have different skins, the scoreboard was also embed in 10 other websites.

As a result, the scoreboard was used and shared by the candidates, also making appearances in the national media.
