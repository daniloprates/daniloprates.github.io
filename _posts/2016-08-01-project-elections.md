UOL's scoreboard for the 2016 Municipal Elections in Brazil. It has received over 17 milion visitors in one day span.

For this project I helped my four member team to decide the technologies and languages to be used. We chose to use Mithril.js, due to its minimal size and great features.

Powered by Halley, UOL's powerfull websocket server, it had live update for the main cities in Brazil and minute-to-minute updates for the remain ones. It allowed the user to favorite cities and candidates do follow the votings count.

Using a skins feature, the scoreboard was also embed in 10 other websites, UOL partners.

As a result, the scoreboard was used and shared by many candidates, also making appearances in the national media.
