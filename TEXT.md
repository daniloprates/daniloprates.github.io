Municipal Election Scoreboard (Development)
http://placar.eleicoes.uol.com.br/2016/1turno/
I was in the four-member team that developed the scoreboard for the 2016 Municipal Elections in Brazil. I helped choose the languages and settings. Packed with features, like the ability to save favorite cities and candidates, open maps, and view real-time results, it received seventeen million visits in one day.

UOL Homepage (Development)
http://www.uol.com.br/
UOL is the largest website in Latin America. I was in the four-member team that developed and manages its homepage, which receives over 7.4 billion visits each month.

VisitBritain (Development)
http://brand42.co.uk/article/lovewall
Working for a small creative agency in central London, I had the chance to develop new features for the official website for Great Britain's tourism organization.
I was first hired to implement the Arabic language, which allowed them to advertise their tourism spots to the Middle East. The Arabic language is is right-to-left oriented, so SASS variables and HTML properties were used to flip the whole content.

Redux Synth (Development)
https://daniloprates.github.io/redux-synth/
This is a personal WIP project. I wanted to gather two things I really enjoy: React.js and synthesizing. Moreover, I was very keen to test Redux.js on a more interesting project. It was equally challenging and enjoyable to see how great Redux.js can be when handling the application state.
In this synthesizer, every piece of state is kept in the Redux store. It's a state-of-the-art piece of code.
