# The GREAT China Naming Campaign



# The GREAT China Naming Campaign Wins 2 Awards at Cannes Lions 2015
Branding  Development  Digital  Strategy  Web-design  Campaigns
Big Congratulations
VisitBritain’s China campaign encouraged visitors to re-name famous British landmarks. It swept away 1 Gold and 1 Silver Lion award at Cannes. The first prize was awarded for use of digital platforms in the 'Travel, Tourism & Leisure' category and the latter impressed in the 'Use of Co-Creation and User-Generated Content' category.

Ogilvy & Mather Beijing was the brains behind this innovative idea while we collaborated with them to deliver the UX and build of this project which has since increased Chinese visits to the UK by a whooping 23%.



The Big Idea
Building on the back of the LoveWall, the big idea was to encourage Chinese tourists to rename the sites they had visited in Great Britain. Our personal favourite landmark, The Shard, was renamed Zhai Xing Ta or in other words “the tower that allows us to pluck stars from the sky”, whilst fellow landmark, The Gherkin, got a much less complimentary name: Xiao Huang Gua or "the pickled little cucumber".
